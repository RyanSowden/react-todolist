# react-todolist

This is my first React app and I decided to make a to do list to teach me the basics of React.

You can add new tasks and alos remove them once theya re complete or no longer required.

Overall I really enjoyed making this project with React and once you get over the learning curve of React I think it is a fantastic framework.

As always if you see any improvements that could be made feel free to let me know or fork the repo and make a pull request.

Other than that you cna do what ever you want with the code as it is and always will be 100% open source :)
